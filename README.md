# My-ERC20
- openzeppelin's implementation of ERC20 vs my own implementation of EIP20
- openzeppelin's implementation in ```Divine-OZ.sol``` covers an inflatory token mintable by the deployer and capped at the ```maxSupply```
- my implementation of EIP20 in ```Divine.sol``` covers the required functions and an additional burn function making the token deflatory since token owners can burn their tokens
